Description: ==========
        GeoAlchemy
        ==========
        
        GIS Support for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_.
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        GeoAlchemy is an extension of SQLAlchemy. It provides support for
        Geospatial data types at the ORM layer using SQLAlchemy. It aims to
        support spatial operations and relations specified by the Open Geospatial
        Consortium (OGC). The project started under Google Summer of Code Program
        under the mentorship of `Mark Ramm-Christensen <http://compoundthinking.com/blog/>`_.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        Requires SQLAlchemy >= 0.5. Supported on python 2.5 and python 2.6.
        Should also work with python 2.4 but has not been tested. It also
        requires a supported spatial database.
        
        
        Supported Spatial Databases
        ---------------------------
        At present `PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`_, `Spatialite
        <http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/>`_ and `MySQL Spatial
        <http://www.mysql.com/>`_  are supported.
        
        Support
        -------
        GeoAlchemy is at an early stage of development. It does not yet have a
        mailing list of its own but support should be available on the SQLAlchemy
        Mailing List or IRC Channel. Also, feel free to email the author directly
        to send bugreports, feature requests, patches, etc.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        To install type as usual::
        
        $ easy_install GeoAlchemy

        You can also generate full documentation using sphinx by doing `make html`
